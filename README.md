WnnIM for OS/2
==============

WnnIM for OS/2 (a.k.a. 'WnnIM/2' or just 'WnnIM') is an Input Method Editor for
typing East Asian (CJK) text under Presentation Manager.

Specifically, WnnIM itself is the front-end processor component, and is designed
to work in conjunction with the open source FreeWnn IME engine on the back-end.
As such, it will (when finished) require the FreeWnn server for the desired
language to be installed and running (not necessarily on the same computer, but
accessible via TCP/IP).

Only Presentation Manager (OS/2 graphical) sessions are supported; DOS and
Win-OS/2 sessions are not.  OS/2 command lines are not supported either,
_except_ for windowed VIO sessions running on DBCS versions of OS/2.

The current version supports Japanese input.  Support for other Asian languages
is planned for future releases.


For Users
---------

The FreeWnn runtime and romkan mode tables must be installed.  These are
included in the FreeWnn RPM packages, which should soon be available from a
repository near you; in the meantime, get `FreeWnn-1.1.1-0.a023.0.i386.rpm` from
[here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B_CmLQmhb3PzelRpakJ6OXl3YnM).

If you don't have a UNIXROOT environment or prefer not to install the RPM for
other reasons, you can extract `wnn0.dll` and the files in the `rk` directory;
place the DLL in your LIBPATH, and the files from `rk` in their own directory
(anywhere), then define the environment variable `ROMKAN_TABLE` to indicate the
fully-qualified path of the file `mode`.  (This will suffice for phonetic input
conversion; full clause conversion, which is not yet implemented, will require
the full FreeWnn server installed either locally or on the local network.)

Make sure `wnnhook.dll` and `wnnim.exe` are in the same directory, and run
'wnnim' to start the IME.  The actual UI is a small window located by default
at the bottom right of your screen (you can move it around by dragging).  The
UI consists of two small buttons and a status panel.

 * The button labelled 'I' toggles input conversion on or off.  You can also
   toggle this setting using Ctrl+Space.
 * The button labelled 'C' toggles CJK clause conversion on or off.  You can
   also toggle this setting using Ctrl+Shift.

There is also a popup context menu which allows you to do various things, such
as select the input conversion mode (currently hiragana, katakana and fullwidth
ASCII are supported), adjust settings, or close the program.

You can also change the input conversion mode using Shift+Space, which will
cycle through the available modes.

The active settings are global, i.e. switching from one program to another will
retain the current conversion mode.  However, settings are _not_ currently saved
when closing the UI.


For Developers
--------------

The included Makefile requires the IBM C Compiler (preferably version 3.65).
It might be possible to build with GCC, but any functions which are explicitly
declared `_Optlink` might have to be changed to `_System` or `_cdecl`.  Also,
the PM hook DLL (see below) is built with the subsystem runtime (ICC `/Rn`
switch) to avoid side effects due to its data segment being SINGLE SHARED; using
GCC or another compiler would probably require some changes to this approach.

Building the client application requires the FreeWnn library and header files;
these are included in the `FreeWnn-devel` RPM (provisionally available from
[here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B_CmLQmhb3PzelRpakJ6OXl3YnM).)

All the FreeWnn-specific code is isolated in one or two source files.  In
principle, the rest of the WnnIM code could probably be used to implement an IME
based on a different engine such as Canna or Anthy (although I have no plans to
try doing such a thing myself).

### Concepts

WnnIM's operation is based around two 'mode' settings which work in conjunction
with each other: _input mode_ and _CJK conversion mode_.

**Note:** Not all of the following has actually been implemented yet.

The input mode controls how typed characters are converted into basic phonetic
characters for the language in question.  The number of modes supported varies
according to language, although 'none' (i.e. no conversion) is always available.
(Japanese, for example, has Hiragana, Katakana, and Fullwidth ASCII modes; 
Korean has only Hangul.)

If the target language uses phonetic characters, then how it works is that all
typed characters are saved into a buffer (known internally as the 'romaji
buffer') until the buffer contents can be successfully converted into phonetic
characters (the results of which are placed in the 'kana buffer').  Once
conversion is successful and unambiguous, the converted characters are inserted
into the application window where the original characters were typed -- unless
CJK conversion is also active, in which case see below.  If conversion is
unsuccessful (i.e. the buffer contents do not represent a valid character in the
target language), then the conversion attempt is abandoned and the current
buffer contents are inserted into the application window unchanged.

[TODO 1: If conversion is successful but ambiguous (that is, the buffer
represents a valid character as-is, but could potentially become a different
character if more letters were added, as may be the case with Korean), then the
current conversion is offered as a 'candidate' for the user to either accept or
continue typing.]

[TODO 2: If the target language does not use phonetic characters, then all of
the above is bypassed: typed characters are simply added to the clause buffer
in place of phonetic characters, and the logic otherwise proceeds as below.
This will probably be the case with Chinese (both types).]

The other mode is CJK (or 'clause') conversion mode.  This mode is a simple
on-or-off toggle.  When active, the phonetic characters which have been
confirmed for entry (per above) will not be sent directly to the application,
but rather added to a 'clause buffer' which is displayed on-screen as an overlay
at the cursor position.  When the user hits a 'convert' key, the current clause
buffer will be converted (if possible) into the Chinese-origin CJK glyphs
(kanji/hanzi/hanja) applicable to the current language.  Since there are usually
multiple possible candidates for conversion, the candidates are displayed in a
pop-up list on screen so the user can accept the correct one.  Once a candidate
is accepted, the full converted clause is inserted in the application window.

In either case, once a conversion (phonetic or clause) is accepted and the
result inserted in the application, all buffers are cleared and the process
starts over.

If the input mode is set to 'none', then all conversion (input and CJK) is
disabled, and typed characters are simply sent to the application as they
are.

### Source Code Organization

`wnnclient.*` implements the interface to the FreeWnn engine (it is linked into
`wnnim.exe`).  If WnnIM were to be adapted to use a different engine, this is
the module that would need to be replaced.

`wnnhook.*` implements a global PM hook, which is loaded by the client (below)
when the latter starts up.  This hook is responsible for intercepting keystrokes
in any running PM application, and either passing it on to the application
directly or running it through WnnIM's conversion logic.

`wnnim.*` is the main client (front-end) application.  It activates the PM hook
(above), and presents the UI controls for the user to operate the IME.  It also
implements most of the actual keypress processing logic (triggered as needed by
the PM hook), for the sake of keeping the hook DLL as lightweight as possible.

`convwin.*` implements the clause conversion (overlay) window.

`settings.*` contains client routines specific to managing user settings.

`codepage.*` contains various useful functions for dealing with text
encodings.

`wnnconv.c` contains some FreeWnn text conversion routines; they are not 
exported by the library and so were simply lifted from the sources.

`ids.h` defines various resource and message IDs used by both the client and the
PM hook.
